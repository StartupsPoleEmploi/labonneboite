# Methods scoring_util.get_hirings_from_score

# rely on special coefficients SCORE_50_HIRINGS, SCORE_60_HIRINGS etc..
# which values in github repository are *fake* and used for dev and test only.
#
# The real values are confidential, stored outside of github repo,
# and only used in staging and production.

# This is designed so that you *CANNOT* guess the hirings based
